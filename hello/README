This is a module template to test hello world.
It has been tested on :
    Linux 3.4 and Android 4.4.2_r2.
	    
For any question, please contact Dongli Zhang @ dongli.zhang0129@gmail.com.

1. Go to the Android kernel folder and run 
    make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-eabi- menuconfig 
Load the .config file and check if all of following options are checked:
(1) Enable loadable module support
(2) Forced module loading
(3) Module unloading
(4) Forced module unloading

Without options above, you will have compiling error:
error: variable '__this_module' has initializer but incomplete type 

2. vim Makefile and change the following path:
/home/zhang/src/android/kernel/goldfish/

3. vim compile.sh and you will have:
CROSS_COMPILE=/home/zhang/src/android/prebuilts/gcc/linux-x86/arm/arm-eabi-4.6/bin/arm-eabi- ARCH=arm make

Change the CROSS_COMPILE on your machine.

4. Run sh compile.sh. You will have:
    hello.ko

5. start the emulator with your compiled kernel image.

6. Run adb push to upload the module into Android emulator.

7. Use insmod as in traditional Linux.
